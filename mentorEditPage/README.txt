-This is the mentor edit page as is, needs to be linked up with loging page. Currently, page only works with a mentor with
id 1, At the moment, the users profile image only shows when he has uploaded a new one, all the code is there to 
display the image on a full page refresh bar one line, not sure if that is wanted though.
-The calendar still requires refreshing the page to switch between the months. 
-Currently no option to change password
-Almost certainly other problems
